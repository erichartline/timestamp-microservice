# Timestamp Microservice

When a string is passed as a parameter, this will provide the UNIX timestamp and natural language date for that string. If there is no date or timestamp, it returns null.

Future Ideas:
- Run my own tests using Mocha/Chai
- Refactor to pass FCC's beta tests

Built using Node.js w/ Express, EJS and Moment.

This is an API challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice).
